# Solidity Auction App

A smart contract-based auction system developed using Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum blockchain. This project allows users to create and participate in auctions in a decentralized manner, ensuring transparency and security.

## Features

- **Decentralized Auctions**: Conduct auctions without intermediaries, leveraging the power of blockchain technology.
- **Bidding System**: Users can place bids on auction items, with the highest bidder winning at the end of the auction period.
- **Time Management**: Auctions have defined start and end times, ensuring fairness and structure.
- **Automatic Fund Handling**: The smart contract securely manages funds, automatically transferring them to the seller upon auction completion.
